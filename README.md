# iTunesApp

**Version 1.0.0**

iTunesApp is the place where you can search for an album and listen to it.

Albums are listed alphabetically. When albums are listed you can click on it and you will be able to see more information about specific album such as cover, album name, artist name, number of songs and copyright along with all the songs that this album includes. But that is not that! By clicking a song the player opens and the chosen song starts to play. You can then stop it and resume or change the track by clicking backward button or forward button. And the volume of the player is adjustable. Just change the value on the slider and the volume will be lower or higher depending on what value you’ve set. Cover image shrinks when the user pauses a song and increases when the user taps resume, it helps user with better understanding of what the app does. It also gives the ability to tap on the Play button and the album will start playing songs in order starting from the first one. And the Shuffle button allows to listen the album from a random song and not from the beginning. 
By default, when the app is launched, the standard albums with «Hey» keyword are listed.
What is also cool about the app is that it supports Dark Mode. A lot of users prefer it, so we should provide a good UI that can be used in Light Mode and in Dark Mode as well.
It’s actually nice to be able to search for an album and play any song but the user has also the ability to add any song into their library and play it from there. Songs that were added latest will be shown at the top and these songs are saved using UserDefaults. It allows the user to close the app and later come back and have all the songs that they added in their library.
If the user still wants more information about the artists they can tap on their names in the detailed album screen and it will open Safari VC with url that leads to iTunes page with these artists.
There is a settings controller where the user can click on profile and it will open new vc with some information. They can tap on the image and choose photo from their library or take a new one.
